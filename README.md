TASKFORGE – A Team Task Management Dashboard

Build a full-featured project management web app (like Trello + Notion-lite) with real-time updates, custom hooks, and advanced TypeScript typing. Key Focus: Intermediate TypeScript + Core React Patterns

Goal: Gain deep fluency in TS types, React hooks, and scalable state management. Build a typed React app using Vite + TypeScript, Zustand for state, and shadcn UI components. This project helps me with intermediate TypeScript, hooks, custom hooks, and local persisted state.

✨ Features:

Workspace & task board creation (CRUD)
Drag-and-drop task movement
User role-based filtering (admin, member)
Dark/light mode toggle
Persisted Zustand state (localStorage or mock API)
Custom hooks for data & theme management
